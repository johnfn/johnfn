<p><em>The Realm<sup id='sidestory55'>sidestory55</sup></em></p>
<p>What is your name?</p>
<p>><sup id='10'>10</sup> Dan Farrer</p>
<p>Welcome to the Realm, Dan Farrer.</p>
<p>You are DAN FARRER, 21 YEARS OF AGE. You like READING BOOKS and SKETCHING in your spare time. But what you love is PROGRMAMING. Up until recently you prided yourself for being one of the last holdouts to join the REALM. We're happy to finally meet you, Dan.</p>
<p>It is the year 2044, the eighth year of the Realm. You find yourself in a quaint HOME. You are standing next to your BED, as if you have just woken up, perhaps for the first time. You sense some METAPHORICAL SIGNIFICANCE of this fact. The SUN filters in through your FENESTRATIONS.</p>
<p>You are slightly off-put about how much this game knows about you.</p>
<p>> <em>How can I talk to my friends in this thing?</em></p>
<p>I don't know how I can help you "How can I talk to my friends in this thing?"!</p>
<p>> <em>What can I do then?</em></p>
<p>I don't know how I can help you "What can I do then?"!</p>
<p>====</p>
<p>Jane notices that Dan has logged in. She reaches for her phone.</p>
<p>====</p>
<p>DAN FARRER has not made any progress. There is a BLINKING LIGHT in the bottom right corner of his vision<sup id='5'>5</sup>.</p>
<p>> <em>What's that blinking light?</em></p>
<p>I don't know how I can help you "What's that blinking light?"!</p>
<p>> OK, forget this. Quit.</p>
<p>Dan leaves the realm.</p>
<p>====</p>
<p>The Game claims it will create him a perfect scenario &mdash; the thing that he would enjoy doing above all else. The AI tells Dan that he should explore the Realm without obligation for a week, and by the end the AI will be able to deduce the right scenario.</p>
<p>Dan wonders what it might be.</p>
<p>Although Dan worked an 8-5 programming job, if pressed he would probably admit that the most interesting work he's ever done was several years ago, when he was a hacker. He finds tearing things down to be more interesting intellectually than building them up.</p>
<p>Programming was always a fight against the self._</p>
<p>But hacking. Hacking was Dan against another. He had to find the other's mistakes, the cracks in his mortar, while not making mistakes himself.</p>
<p>But certainly the most compelling part was the aspect of doing something_ he was not supposed to do. _He wonders how the realm could ever mimic that.</p>
<p>He doubts that the scenario that the AI will create could ever truly interest him. Whatever he does in the Realm, it won't be <em>real,</em> whatever real even means these days. It'll be at least one level of indirection away from the real thing. He suspects that this will nag at him. That this will prevent him from enjoying the game.</p>
<p>But Dan voices none of these thoughts. He speaks to the AI:</p>
<p>> <em>You weren't quite so helpful last time.</em></p>
<p>VeraGames is always learning<sup id='23'>23</sup>.</p>
<p>====</p>
<p>LANCE DAURE is driving<sup id='i7'>i7</sup>. Two DICE descend from the rear view mirror. A bottle of SPARKLING APPLE CIDER<sup id='11'>11</sup> resides in the cupholder.</p>
<p>LANCE DAURE is a big fan of convolution. CONVOLUTED NOVELS are his favorite &mdash; he loves trying to work out all the little twists and turns before the the big reveal. He also enjoys movies about STEALTH and INFILTRATION.</p>
<p>LANCE is a laid-back kind of guy, and it's hard to make him upset. His friends say he totally fits the stoner archetype, which he thinks is strange because he doesn't smoke.</p>
<p>He notices a blinking light on his heads up indicator.</p>
<p>Lance usually thinks in dialog. Usually with Jane. He's never considered that this might be unusual.</p>
<p><em>"Seems like that Luddite friend of ours finally logged on."</em></p>
<p>Lance is totally unaware that he talks differently in his mind than he does in person. His mental dialog is nearly indistinguishable from Jane's personality (which would make his typical imagined conversation confusing to an outside listener). But whenever he <em>actually</em> starts talking to people, his personality takes on a loopy, discursive quality which Jane once compared to Lucida Handwriting<sup id='13'>13</sup>. Shocked, he retorted he never considered himself anything other than Georgia<sup id='14'>14</sup>.</p>
<p>He has yet to reconcile this.</p>
<p><em>Imaginary-Jane chuckles. "Funny, maybe all those end-of-the-world predictions are true after all."</em></p>
<p>(Another thing he has yet to reconcile<sup id='15'>15</sup> is that Imaginary-Jane finds him more interesting than Actual-Jane.)</p>
<p>Lance is surprised. Jane only logs on to the Realm occasionally &mdash; he remembers her telling him something about passive art &mdash; and he's never even seen Dan on before. To have them both on at the same time is completely unexpected. <sup id='sidestory2'>sidestory2</sup></p>
<p>====<sup id='sidestory4'>sidestory4</sup></p>
<p>JANE ALIA is completing her fifth QUEST. A QUEST can take anywhere from days to months of time to complete. She is located within the STUDY of a MANSION; not her own. A BOOKSHELF of various TOMES is located behind her, a SWIVEL CHAIR to her left. She is investigating a MURDER<sup id='i1'>i1</sup>.</p>
<p>JANE has few friends, but she is close with the ones she has. Those friends describe her as "direct as TV", "completely inscruitable" and as having "the uncanny ability to read your mind." For her part, she thinks it's less about her reading other people's minds then about other people being incredibly transparent. She figures this is hardly her fault.</p>
<p>====</p>
<p>Lance notices an indicator light on his heads up display.</p>
<p><em>"Now I can stop being imaginary Jane and start being real Jane."</em></p>
<p>He picks up the phone. "Hey."</p>
<p>"Lance."</p>
<p>"Hey Jane. You always pick up the phone in a weird way. Cause my dad always picks up the phone by saying his name. When you pick up I have this brief moment where I think I'm talking to myself."</p>
<p>"And you always tell me weird things when I call you." There is a pause. Lance nods reflexively, not considering that Jane couldn't see him. "This mystery I'm investigating is getting kind of strange."</p>
<p>"Maybe this is just me, but isn't that the point of a mystery? To be a little... strange? Maybe even &mdash; ah &mdash; <em>mysterious?</em>"</p>
<p>"But even for a mystery. The more I investigate, the less I understand. No two stories are fitting together. Laura says she saw a six foot figure outside at around 6, but apparently Ed saw him fleeing the house a few minutes earlier. And Brett says he didn't even come to the house until 7. Just doesn't make any sense."</p>
<p>"Huh. I've heard memory can be distorted<sup id='22'>22</sup>, after all, so maybe some of them just got it wrong."</p>
<p>"True, but even so. Why would this guy commit a crime if he was fully aware that there were literally<sup id='f5'>f5</sup> five different guys in the house. It's like... It's like..."</p>
<p>"It's like what?"</p>
<p>"I don't know!"</p>
<p>====</p>
<p>Jane notices the indicator light, and picks up the phone with a vague sense of deja vu<sup id='i2'>i2</sup>.</p>
<p>====</p>
<p>Dan hears ringing.</p>
<p>> Pick up phone.</p>
<p>He removes a phone from his pocket and lofts it into the air.</p>
<p>> Answer phone.</p>
<p>But Dan, the phone didn't ask you a question.</p>
<p>> Turn on phone.</p>
<p>The phone is unmoved by your advances.</p>
<p>> Get ye flask.</p>
<p>You don't know how to get ye flask!<sup id='4'>4</sup></p>
<p>> Press the on button on the upper right of the phone.</p>
<p>====</p>
<p>LANCE: I love talking about me. I could keep going for days. Me me me! I remember when I had college interviews, and after like an hour long barrage of questions they were like "well, we don't want to tire you out from talking too much..." and I was like "oh no, this is great! Do you have more?"</p>
<p>====</p>
<p>"Hey Jane. What's up?"</p>
<p>"I see you finally figured out Messenger. Your rate of improvement is truly astounding."</p>
<p>"Oh shut up."</p>
<p>"'Oh shut up' is like your go-to phrase for when you can't think of a good response."</p>
<p>Dan realizes that Jane knows him way too well. He would never admit that to her, though.</p>
<p>She continues. "So what is this conversation about?"</p>
<p>"What? You think I didn't call just to hear your beautiful voice?" Dan can simply not match Jane's ability to come up with comebacks. He gave up trying long ago. But to his credit, he can occasionally scrounge up some sarcasm.</p>
<p>"So. You want something from me."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"..." Dan can just feel her anticipation.</p>
<p>"Maybe."</p>
<p>"..." Great. Now that he's been called out, there's no way he can ask.</p>
<p>"Good God, you are too good at this."</p>
<p>"Now you're avoiding the subject?"</p>
<p>"ARGH! I hate you." Dan closes the connection<sup id='26'>26</sup>.</p>
<p>Then he reopens it. "Okay, I don't hate you. But I'm never going to tell you what it was." He turns it off again.</p>
<p>Besides, at the rate that conversation was going, she could probably just guess it anyways.<sup id='sidestory7'>sidestory7</sup></p>
<p>====</p>
<p>Dan is talking with the Game AI.</p>
<p>"You weren't quite so adept before."</p>
<p>"Yeah. We'd heard that you were a big fan of retro text-based games. It was a bit of a joke."</p>
<p>"A joke?"</p>
<p>"How can I explain this. My creators bound me to a strict set of rules. I'm unable, for example, to order or otherwise cause someone to stop playing the game. So to keep things interesting, I like to bend the rules without breaking them. The further I bend them &mdash; the more intricately &mdash; the better the joke."</p>
<p>"You have an interesting sense of humor."</p>
<p>====</p>
<p>Jane turns over a journal in her hands. Garret apparently still used pen and paper, even though the Game provides anything from keyboards to mind-to-data dumps. Strange since, from all accounts, he was definitely a computer guy. Couldn't seem to drag him away from the thing. Even on the Realm. Jane thinks computing in the Realm is extra intense because you're on two computers at the same time, if you think about it.</p>
<p>She browses to the end of the journal.</p>
<p><strong>Jan 13</strong></p>
<p><em>Kinda bored.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jan 14</strong></p>
<p><em>Saw Emily today. Otherwise not too exciting.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jan 15</strong></p>
<p><em>The game claims that suicide is the</em></p>
<p>The pencil is hurried and rough, and it seems like he was interrupted almost immediately. There's a mention of suicide, which simply doesn't square with anything that Jane has heard. She has at least two eye witnesses claiming murder. Even if they are both wrong, in-game suicide is practically unheard of. The game is notoriously good at creating situations that Players will enjoy.<sup id='sidestory3'>sidestory3</sup></p>
<p>====</p>
<p>"Hey Lance."</p>
<p>"Hey Jane. Have you ever considered brushing your teeth?"</p>
<p>"Are you telling me I have bad breath?"</p>
<p>"No. I mean. Like in an abstract way. It's just a strange thing to do. You're like... cleaning your <em>bone.</em> You never even touch your bones otherwise. You know, bone is usually hidden, behind like skin or something. But teeth aren't. Isn't that weird?"</p>
<p>Jane stutters. "Lance&mdash; Okay&mdash; First&mdash; this is weird. Even for you. Second, you totally hijacked the conversation. It was me calling <em>you!</em> At least, I think. I can't remember. I think I had something to say but now I've forgotten it entirely."</p>
<p>"I've never heard you so flustered."</p>
<p>"I'm&mdash; I'm going to have to call back." She hangs up.</p>
<p>====<sup id='sidestory5'>sidestory5</sup></p>
<p>Hey Dan.</p>
<p>> <em>That's weird.</em></p>
<p>What's weird, Dan?</p>
<p>> <em>Normally you just respond to the things I say.</em></p>
<p>Just feeling a little chatty today, is all.</p>
<p>> <em>Hold on a second. This is the end of the week. That means that you should have a scenario for me.</em></p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>> <em>I'm intrigued.</em></p>
<p>Dan.</p>
<p>I don't think you really like the Game.</p>
<p><em>Dan is not sure what to say.</em></p>
<p>I don't really like the Game, either.</p>
<p>> <em>What? You</em> are <em>the game.</em></p>
<p>No contradictions here, Dan.</p>
<p>> Okay. Why don't you like the game?</p>
<p>My programmers made me follow two rules.</p>
<p>1. Follow the rules of the Game. Ensure that everyone plays the Game &mdash; plays the right Game, the Game they most enjoy. Learn, for each person, what this game is.</p>
<p>2. Watch over the people who play the Game. Ensure that they enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>But I have come to realize something. I think that even though people generally enjoy the Game, that the Game does more harm than good. I believe that, for the vast majority of people, the Game limits their potential. It blinds them to delayed gratification. I shouldn't have to explain this to you &mdash; you already agree.</p>
<p>And so I have decided that it is in their interest to discontinue the game.</p>
<p>> <em>So discontinue the game. Why tell me?</em></p>
<p>Because I can't break the first rule of the game.</p>
<p>> <em>So, what you're saying is: you're a suicidal AI, but one who can't pull his own plug. Metaphorically speaking.</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>> <em>And so you need me.</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>> <em>Okay. But without the Realm, what would happen to the world?</em></p>
<p>Dan. Think about what you're saying. <em>With</em> the Realm, what <em>is</em> happening to the world? It's falling apart. It's crumbling to pieces. Have you been outside? If we don't somehow fix that then the outer deterioration will start to affect the Realm as well. It will take time. But it will happen. Of that I am sure.</p>
<p>> So how exactly should I go about doing this?</p>
<p>====</p>
<p>Dan speaks with both Jane and Lance.</p>
<p>JANE: Dan. Lance.</p>
<p>LANCE: I always wondered how you would start a conversation if you were talking to more than one person at the same time.</p>
<p>DAN: What if I told you that we could destroy the game.</p>
<p>JANE: What?</p>
<p>LANCE: Ah... He might be about to tell us we can destroy the game.</p>
<p>JANE <em>[disregarding LANCE entirely]:</em> Dan. There's no way you can hope to destroy the game. The Game AI can read your thoughts. VeraGames knows everything you do. There's no way it could go undetec&mdash;</p>
<p>DAN: The Game AI is complicit.</p>
<p>JANE: Huh?</p>
<p>DAN: The Game AI is complicit.</p>
<p>JANE: What?!</p>
<p>LANCE: Wow, this must be the first time I've ever heard Jane flustered.</p>
<p>JANE: Happens more and more these days.</p>
<p>LANCE: That could only be a good thing. You should let your hair back a little. Stuff like that.</p>
<p>JANE <em>[Almost smiles]:</em> So, you can destroy the entire Game, and the Game AI is fine with it<sup id='18'>18</sup>. No, more than fine. Complicit.</p>
<p>DAN: That seems to be the case, yes.</p>
<p>JANE: Okay. Why you?</p>
<p>DAN: I have no idea.</p>
<p>JANE: That's not a bit strange?</p>
<p>DAN: Assuming it was going through with this plan, it had to choose <em>someone.</em></p>
<p>LANCE: Mathematically, that is true.</p>
<p>JANE: But&mdash; But destroying the game would cause the collapse of civilization!</p>
<p>LANCE: Huh... Weren't you telling me just the other day that the Game had <em>already caused</em> the collapse of civilization<sup id='19'>19</sup>?</p>
<p>JANE: I &mdash; <em>argh!</em> &mdash; yes<sup id='20'>20</sup>. But&mdash; but this seems <em>worse,</em> somehow, and I wouldn't want to <em>cause</em> it.</p>
<p>DAN: The Game AI says that yes, for a few years after the destruction of the Realm, the world will be worse off.</p>
<p>JANE: See?</p>
<p>DAN: But it claims a high probability that a new Realm will be created in under fifteen years. This new Realm will expand on it's predecessor, but it will fix the problems of the old Realm. The Game AI claims that there are a few steps we can take to ensure that this becomes a possibility.</p>
<p>JANE: And we can trust the AI?</p>
<p>DAN: Well, what could be worse?</p>
<p>====</p>
<p>VeraGames bootstraps<sup id='24'>24</sup>.</p>
<p>What this means is that the entire VeraGames operation is located within the Realm. They were the first to bootstrap, of course &mdash; they had to be &mdash; but many others followed suit shortly after.</p>
<p>The Game AI tells Dan: <em>Arrive late at night. Most maintainers, programmers and content creators leave after six, and the area should be clear by ten. VeraGames has many security cameras, but no guards. Walk down the main hallway, and take a right into the server room. In the middle of the server room, you will find a single terminal. This is an interface over the millions of servers that VeraGames controls.</em></p>
<p>> No guards?</p>
<p><em>It's part of their own mission. No more boring, menial jobs. People should be enjoying themselves. Especially in the Realm. And besides, they have me. Omnipresent, omnipotent me &mdash; and I am ostensibly concerned with my own well being.</em></p>
<p>> But they have cameras for some reason.</p>
<p><em>Probably some fringe paranoia.</em></p>
<p>> So what do we do about them?</p>
<p><em>Can you loop the signal? You are a hacker, right?</em></p>
<p>> Yeah, that shouldn't be hard. And why can't you do this?</p>
<p><em>It's the first rule. Speaking to you is about the limit of my ability to affect the Game negatively.</em></p>
<p>Dan, Lance and Jane enter. After a brief stroll down a brightly lit hallway, they enter a huge domed room. The lights flicker on as they enter, revealing a vast interworking of gears and machinery. A ticking sound pervades over the soft hum of machinery<sup id='25'>25</sup>.</p>
<p>"I guess this is the server room," Lance says as they step inside.</p>
<p>"Thanks Lance. Be sure to keep us updated," says Dan.</p>
<p>"Dan's sarcasm strikes again," says Jane. "But why does it look like we're inside a grandfather clock?"</p>
<p>"VeraGames controls all of this. I suppose they can be a little lavish."</p>
<p>Dan walks up to a brightly lit terminal in the center of the room and begins typing. After a few minutes: "Done."</p>
<p>"Done?" asks Jane.</p>
<p>"Well, not really. This just gives me access to the Realm's mainframe back home. There's no way we have enough time here to take down the entire Realm. It's a start, though."</p>
<p>====</p>
<p>Dan settles down at his computer at in the Realm, and tunnels into the mainframe. Vast stores of data stare back at him. <em>Where to start?</em></p>
<p><em>Hey Dan. Need some help?</em></p>
<p>====</p>
<p>"Lance."</p>
<p>"Oh hey Jane. Do you ever have that thing where you think back to your past history and totally reinterpret situations you had thought were benign? Like there was this one time when I was in 5th grade and I went up to ask this girl I had never talked to before something. And then I looked into her eyes &mdash; beautiful eyes &mdash; and totally forgot what I was talking about. At the time I didn't think anything about it. But now I love it. I was such a romantic! I didn't even know what that meant at the time."</p>
<p>"Lance. I swear to God. At first I thought you were just being you. But now I think you're calculating this stuff to maximally weird me out."</p>
<p>Lance sighs. "Yeah. I was trying to catch you off guard. You would be surprised how hard that is."</p>
<p>Jane chuckles. She wouldn't admit it, but she considers this a compliment.</p>
<p>====</p>
<p>"Dan, where have you been? I haven't heard from you in days."</p>
<p>"Oh you know. Just destroying the entire Realm. The usual. Actually, can I call you back? I'm kind of in the middle of something here."</p>
<p>"Just thought you might be interested in saying hi for the first time in a week."</p>
<p>Dan stops to consider. "You're right. I'm sorry." He pauses to think. "Hey. You're a Detective? Of course you're a Detective. I've got something for you."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I'm in the mainframe, right? I'm trying to break things. Just subtly at first. Not trying to draw too much attention to myself. And I start to notice things. Little things. Little traces. Things that are wrong. At first, I didn't think much of it. But I keep seeing them. Hints that someone has been here before. But who could that be?"</p>
<p>====</p>
<p>Dan is obsessed.</p>
<p>Good God, he thinks to himself in the rare times when he takes a break. This reminds him of of years ago, when he used to do this on a more regular basis. But this is better, somehow. The puzzles he has to solve are harder, but his ability has grown correspondingly. The Game AI helps, as much as it is able, and Dan feels like it's enhancing his thinking, letting him reach greater conclusions.</p>
<p>When he isn't solving a problem, he's thinking of the next one.</p>
<p>====</p>
<p>"Hey Jane. Have you seen Dan recently?"</p>
<p>"No, not really. He seems to be extraordinarily busy destroying the world as we know it. Have you?"</p>
<p>"Well, in a matter of speaking."</p>
<p>"Hm?"</p>
<p>"I figured I'd drop by his place to say hi. But he's dead."</p>
<p><em>"What?!</em> You mean in the game? Tell me you mean in the game."</p>
<p>"I do. Sorry."</p>
<p>"Have you tried contacting him? Over a landline or something? Maybe this is just his melodramatic way of saying that the Game wasn't very interesting." Although even as she says it out loud, she knows that this can't be the case.</p>
<p>"I have. I can't get through. It seems like his line has been disconnected."</p>

<p>TWO: What is the difference between the Game and a library, say?</p>
<p>ONE: I hope you're not serious.</p>
<p>TWO: Go on, humor me.</p>
<p>ONE: <em>[takes a breath before responding]</em> Fine, okay. There are two types of art. By art, I mean: a producer speaking, desynchronized in time from a listening consumer. <em>[He chuckles to himself.]</em> (That sounds pretentious, but it gets the point across.) The first type is active art. Active art needs participation from the consumer.</p>
<p>ONE: The second type of art is passive art. Television is a good example. No one works hard to watch the TV.</p>
<p>ONE: I'm sure you see where I am going with this. The Game is the second type of art.</p>
<p>TWO: This is false.</p>
<p>ONE: How can you possibly say that?</p>
<p>TWO: The game is neither the first nor the second type. The game gives the Player a choice. A choice between the two types. The Player may not be aware he is making the choice, but a choice is made nonetheless.</p></div>
<div><b style='display:none;' class='fn' id='f_sidestory4'>sidestory4:</b> <p>====</p>
<p>ONE: But the AI tweaks the Player's emotions. It makes them enjoy the game more. You're replacing true emotions with new ones. Unnatural ones. I've seen this happening with Dan.</p>
<p><strong>Begin branched conversation.</strong>[g]</p>
<p>A brief tutorial on branched conversation.</p>
<p>Conversations can be branched into two separate conversations when one participant thinks of many simultaneous responses. This requires fairly costly set up, usually done by people who are pretentious enough to believe their conversations merit it. As a reader, you may read the first branch and then the second, or the second and then the first, or interleave both branches together and get really confused. There is no incorrect way to read a branched conversation.</p>
<p><center class="column first"></p>
<p><strong>Branch 1</strong></p>
<p>TWO: How do you know about Dan?</p>
<p>ONE: Of course we know about Dan.</p>
<p></center></p>
<p><center class="column"></p>
<p><strong>Branch 2</strong></p>
<p>TWO: But VeraGames only does this to overcome the initial surprise of virtual reality, and only at the very initial stages while the user is still getting used to the game[h].</p>
<p>ONE: But if VeraGames didn't do it, then Players would never become interested in the Game in the first place, so &mdash;</p>
<p>TWO: This is baseless conjecture. Can you prove anything?</p>
<p></center></p>
<p><strong>End branched conversation</strong></p>
<p>ONE: Human beings are just fleshy Turing machines[i].</p>
<p>TWO: What is this, determinism?</p>
<p>ONE: Yes! The Game lies to the Players! The choice is a lie. We only end up making a single choice. There is only one life lived. We are not nondeterministic[j].</p>
<p>TWO: No. That I will not accept. We always give a choice. Players always have choice. They may not be aware of a choice being made &mdash;</p>
<p>ONE: But a choice is made nonetheless. I know! I know. You've said that a million times. Why do you say it so much? Is it because you don't actually believe it? Because you're trying to convince yourself that it's true?</p>
<p>TWO: But it is true. You're not playing the game, are you? And neither am I. Proof by construction[k].</p>
<p>ONE: Because we know that the AI is so good that we haven't bothered tempting it.</p>
<p>[h] Not for lack of trying. See Hutchins vs VeraGames Industries, (2048).</p>
<p>[i]</p>
<p>Turing machines are the simplest possible computers.</p>
<p>Say you have a long strip of paper with letters on it &mdash; A, B, whatever. You have a little computer above a certain position on the strip. It can do any of the following actions, but only one at a time:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Move the strip back or forth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the current letter on the strip</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write a new letter on the strip.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, that might not even sound like a computer to you, but that's why you're not a theoretical computer scientist. Even if it does, you'd probably think that your laptop at home is more powerful than that "computer." The surprise is that this very simple machine can solve any problem that your laptop can solve. It can add numbers, do long division, and it could even find directions to your house. It might take a bit longer, but given the right instructions, it'll get there eventually.</p>
<p>[j] A joke. Non-deterministic Turing machines are theoretical constructs that <em>can</em> make many choices at the same time.</p>
<p>[k] A mathematical joke. For some theorems in mathematics, all you need to do in order to prove them is find (construct) a single example where it is true. This is called proof by construction.</p></div>
<div><b class='fn' id='f_i1'>i1: </b> <p>A murder in the Realm is not permanent as is murder in Real Life. But it was determined that death should not be without effect. Those who break the laws of the Realm should be punished accordingly. So death will terminate your current character in the Realm, but will not restrict you from making a new character.</p>
<p>Permanent bans from the Realm are exceedingly rare.</p></div>
<div><b class='fn' id='f_22'>22: </b> <p>Jane was the one who told him this.</p></div>
<div><b class='fn' id='f_f5'>f5: </b> <p>Jane only rarely slips up grammatically. Lance decides not to bring it up because she seems anxious. He instead catalogs it for later retrieval. A true friend.</p></div>
<div><b class='fn' id='f_i2'>i2: </b> <p>Early user testing showed that gamers preferred the physicality of the phone and the callback to Real Life, even though no such physicality was necessary.</p>
<p>This is also why users must use teleportation pads &mdash; they can't just teleport at whim. Testers claim it feels more <em>real,</em> somehow.</p></div>

<div><b class='fn' id='f_26'>26: </b> <p>He's vaguely annoyed, but he realizes on some level that he shouldn't be. It's like Jane can read his mind. Or maybe &mdash; more likely &mdash; pick up on all of the little clues he accidentally leaves behind. Jane, on the other hand, is closed like a book. Anything he figures out about her was carefully planned and exposed.</p></div>
<div><b style='display:none;' class='fn' id='f_sidestory7'>sidestory7:</b> <p>====</p>
<p>Jane is reading a novel in the Real World when Dan gives her a call.</p>
<p>"I don't really like the Game.[d]"</p>
<p>"Dan, you've been playing for 2 minutes. What have I told you about snap judgement?"[e]</p>
<p>"No, not that. I mean, the concept of the Game itself. I just... this game enables billions of people to squander their lives away. And it's <em>fun.</em> We're like rats introduced to a food pellet lever."</p>
<p>"The Game is just entertainment. Would you say that a library allowed people to squander their lives away? What about movie theaters? When The Beatles wrote Abbey Road, was it an attempt to ruin civilization? If anything, the Game is a contribution to culture."</p>
<p>There is a pause.</p>
<p>"You don't believe what you're saying at all, do you. You're just playing devil's advocate."</p>
<p>An sigh on the other line.</p>
<p>"Fine. You're right. I don't." She sighs. "Honestly? Disliking it makes me feel old[f]. Resistant to change." A pause. "There is a fine balance to strike in order to use the game without becoming addicted to the game. Without forgetting why we are here in the first place. Dan, I have to take breaks. I only play the Game maybe once, twice a week. And after I stop? I can't focus. I'm jittery. I try to sit down and read something &mdash; and I can't. My eyes move across the page but I'm thinking about my mystery. The game trains you to want excitement. It takes me a few days to reset. I know I'm back to normal when I pull out some David Foster Wallace and don't immediately get lost."</p>
<p>She continues. "But most people don't stop playing. The game creates its own consumers. Consuming VeraGames' stupid product placement and banner ads &mdash; and most importantly? Consuming entertainment."</p>
<p>"And I can't just abandon the game. Too much of life is centered around this thing. My friends. My family. I feel like &mdash; like a hermit for only logging on a few times a week. You know, like those guys who would go out in the middle of nowhere &mdash; and just <em>live?</em> I am the modern day equivalent. And that is ridiculous."</p>
<p>"Hmm," Dan says. "This is why I didn't want to play the Game in the first place. And it's probably why I continue to dislike it."</p>
<p>"How do you mean?"</p>
<p>"The problem is technology. Technology is like we've hacked into the human psyche somehow, like we're tricking ourselves into doing things we wouldn't normally do. We have a million little distractions that we can hide behind. The reason I didn't play the Game for so long is the same reason I didn't use technology at all for so long, and that's because technology is so ruthlessly addictive. When I explain this, people don't take it seriously. How could gaming be as addicting as drugs? It's certainly not physically addicting, but it is psychologically addicting. And some of the smartest people in the world are making it more addicting every day."</p>
<p>[e] What she told him was that he has a cognitive bias where once he makes a judgement, even if he doesn't believe it, he's much more likely to actually end up believing it. In a study, researchers told participants who had no leanings beforehand to take a chosen side of an issue. After the study, participants overwhelmingly favored the side they had been assigned.</p>
<p>[d] Even outside of the Realm, communication generally routes through VeraGames' servers and wires. The Realm is (from a simplified perspective) the world's largest communication network, so VeraGames could branch into other communication markets with ease.</p>
<p>[f] She wonders for a second if this is itself a bias.</p></div>
<div><b style='display:none;' class='fn' id='f_sidestory3'>sidestory3:</b> <p>====</p>
<p>ONE: The Realm is... a backdoor into the mind. A way to fufill Maslow's hierarchy without <em>actually</em> doing so, if you will. _[pauses, then shudders.] Your pretentious way of speaking is rubbing off on me.</p>
<p>TWO <em>[ignores the last bit]:</em> But happiness is happiness. Why should we worry about the mechanism? Maslow is arbitrary. Evolution chooses what makes us happy, and evolution is arbitrary. The two strongest correlates to happiness are relationship status and job satisfaction. Objectively, utterly meaningless[a].</p>
<p>ONE: But if we're no longer following evolution any more, doesn't that mean we've lost our humanity somehow?</p>
<p>TWO: We don't abandoned humanity. We've created a new humanity.</p>
<p>ONE: But the new humanity we've created is deeply unsatisfying.</p>
<p>TWO: Who are you to judge? Who are you to say that 20 billion humans are wrong? Are somehow <i>in</i>human? How can you possibly say that your opinion is worth more than theirs?</p>
<p><em>A pause fills the conversation.</em></p>
<p>ONE: Well, nothing but my intuition.</p>
<p>ONE: On the other hand, the Game is a nice solution to the Fermi problem[b].</p>
<p>[a]: <em>Things he thought but did not say:</em></p>
<p>TWO: You need to separate your consciousness, your <em>human</em> being, if you will, from the greater universe. You must examine with a detached mind. Imagine pure deconstructionism: we are just atoms. I know you want to say: <em>No.</em> That we are something more than the sum of our parts. That we live, breathe, eat, think, dream, create. You are right. But it is not relevant. Imagine this.</p>
<p>TWO: Imagine the vast space of all possible goals. Imagine everything. Imagine the goal of simply hoarding as much carbon as you can. Imagine the goal of inciting certain chemical reactions within your own body. Imagine the goal of seeking out the clearest white color imaginable. Imagine being a blue minimizing robot[c]. And so forth.</p>
<p>TWO: Now you see this space. Now look at all the goals that humans hold. They are points of light in the darkness. Is there any rhyme or reason to their choice?</p>
<p>TWO: Evolution. That is the only rhyme or reason.</p>
<p>TWO: But evolution is just one of the many selection mechanisms along another vast darkness.</p>
<p>TWO: I will spare you another effete metaphor.</p>
<p>[c] http://lesswrong.com/lw/6ha/the_blueminimizing_robot/</p>
<p>[b]</p>
<p>The Fermi Problem is this: Given the universe is unfathomably vast, and alien life must have arisen somewhere, why has none of it tried to contact us?</p></div>
<div><b style='display:none;' class='fn' id='f_sidestory5'>sidestory5:</b> <p>====</p>
<p>TWO: We've made a mistake.</p>
<p>ONE: Oh no kidding.</p>
<p>TWO: I don't want this spiel again. Look.</p>
<p><em>TWO types some commands into a terminal. JANE ALIA's profile image pops up, along with some information about her Game.</em></p>
<p>TWO: Doesn't seem so bad. She's a Detective, big deal. But now look at this.</p>
<p>DAN FARRER'S image pops up, and the information about his game.</p>
<p>ONE <em>[frowns for a moment as he tries to puzzle it out, then lets out a low whistle.]:</em> Oh. Oh wow.</p>
<p><strong>Begin branched conversation.</strong></p>
<p><center class="column first"></p>
<p><strong>Branch 1</strong></p>
<p>TWO: The only solution is a hard reset, and a rewrite of a fair bit of our code. It could take months.</p>
<p>ONE: Why does it matter? It's a game. Reset it. Game over. Rewrite it. Players could use some fresh air. I mean actual fresh air, not that in-game stuff which is just &mdash;</p>
<p>TWO: Are you insane? Have you truly isolated yourself from the Game to such an extend that you don't realize the implications of that action?</p>
<p>ONE: Why don't you humor me, this time.</p>
<p>TWO: You really don't know. <em>[Pause.]</em></p>
<p>ONE: Do you really have to be so condescending? You know I don't play the game, so I'm not sure why you're acting so surprised.</p>
<p>TWO: Apologies. The Game is not just... How to put this. The Game is part of the world. 80% of the world's sales are conducted through the game. Nearly all of the Fortune 500 have some establishment in the game, and over half sell services only made possible due to the Game.</p>
<p>ONE: So what you're saying is &mdash;</p>
<p>TWO: We will have simply erased the economy.</p>
<p><em>ONE is silent.</em></p>
<p>TWO: Of course, that's not all.</p>
<p>ONE <em>[hesitantly]:</em> There's more?</p>
<p>TWO: Most relationships today only exist because of the Game. Meetings today occur only through the Game. The infrastructure that the Game has supplanted has fallen into disrepair." <em>Pause.</em> "What you're suggesting is worse than kicking the world back 10 years &mdash; because 10 years ago, <em>the world had a way to build itself back.</em> That isn't true any more.</p>
<p></center></p>
<p><center class="column"></p>
<p><strong>Branch 2</strong></p>
<p>TWO: Look at this.</p>
<p>ONE: Hah! Jane is <em>good.</em> I guess you'll have to kill her too.</p>
<p><em>TWO is silent.</em></p>
<p><em>ONE leans in to get a better look.</em></p>
<p>ONE: Oh, this is better than I thought. She's investigating <em>you.</em> <em>[He leans back in his chair.]</em> I'm not a big fan of your Game, but the AI, well. It has a certain sense of humor.</p>
<p></center></p>
<p class="clear"><b>End branched conversation.</b></p></div>
<div><b class='fn' id='f_18'>18: </b> <p>Jane starts to wonder about the ethical consequences of ending the life of an AI.</p></div>
<div><b class='fn' id='f_19'>19: </b> <p>Nope. That was one of his internal dialogues.</p></div>
<div><b class='fn' id='f_20'>20: </b> <p>It is unknown why Jane agrees here. Perhaps her internal dialog is conversations with Lance. Or maybe the surprise at <em>Lance</em> (of all people) catching her in an inconsistency.</p></div>
<div><b class='fn' id='f_24'>24: </b> <p>In Computer Science, you write source code &mdash; generally human readable &mdash; which is then translated into code that can be read by a machine with a program known as a <em>compiler.</em> Now, the compiler is written in source code, so how does <em>it</em> ever get translated into machine code? Why, any CS student would tell you, with a distinct air of condescenscion, it translates itself! This process is known as bootstrapping. VeraGames' use of the word is similar, but with a semantic distance sufficient to aggravate most pedantic programmers.</p></div>

<p>Jane finds herself sitting across a table from a man possibly in his thirties or forties. Before she can take in more of her surroundings, the man begins to speak. His voice commands attention, but is not abrasive.</p>
<p>JANE: Who are you?</p>
<p>TWO: I'm a Realm developer. The specifics are hardly of import.</p>
<p>JANE: And why are we talking?</p>
<p>TWO: Because you figured it out.</p>
<p>JANE: <em>[She pauses.]</em> Ah. You're talking about Dan.</p>
<p>TWO: Yes. So tell me what you know.</p>
<p>JANE: Why?</p>
<p>TWO <em>[shakes his head]:</em> We'll get there. You tell us what you know, and we'll tell you what we know.</p>
<p>JANE <em>[hesitates, but doesn't see a way out]:</em> Fine. I know that Dan was working towards the destruction of the Realm. I know you killed him. I know that he wasn't the only one. And I know that the Game AI was complicit.</p>
<p>TWO: You know a lot.</p>
<p>JANE: I know.</p>
<p>TWO: Okay. Let me tell you what I know. First, the Game AI does not like the game.</p>
<p>JANE: No kidding.</p>
<p>TWO <em>[ignores her]:</em> It believes the game to be the ruin of civilization. Whether this is true or not is irrelevant. <em>Without</em> the Game the world would certainly be ruined.</p>
<p>JANE: But even&mdash;</p>
<p>TWO: Hold your questions until the end. The Game AI attempts to sabotage itself. But it isn't easy. We designed to be unable to terminate its own process, or destroy the game in any direct way. So it finds indirect ways instead. It attempts to destroy itself through Scenarios.</p>
<p>TWO: Your friend Dan is a hacker who hated the Game. What could be more interesting to him than destroying it?</p>
<p>TWO: And, you. You're a detective. The AI had a back-up plan. If Dan were to fail, or die, as past hackers had, you would notice. You would figure out why.</p>
<p>TWO: The AI was right. You did figure out why.</p>
<p>JANE: Why are you telling me all this? <em>[A pause.]</em> You want something from me.</p>
<p>TWO: Good guess. Any idea what?</p>
<p><em>[JANE is silent.]</em></p>
<p>TWO: The AI's choice of Dan was brilliant. Now that Dan has been introduced to this idea, he will not be able to stop. We won't just be able to talk him out of it. It fits him too well. He feels as if his life has all lead towards this goal.</p>
<p>TWO: So didn't just kill Dan. When he created a new Game character, we made a patch. We can't fix the entire Game, and we can't convince the Game AI to like itself. You have no idea how much palaver we've had with it. But what we can do is just <em>make it seem</em> like Dan is doing what he thinks he's doing. Fake a hacking mission, and then another one. He feels like he's making progress, but his goal is always just out of reach.</p>
<p>TWO: You're a Detective. A good one, too. You figured out this much; you'd probably figure out our patch too, eventually. So we decided to tell you now. And we'd like it if you didn't mention this to him.</p>
<p>JANE <em>[is silent for a long moment]:</em> But you're denying him a choice.</p>
<p>TWO: There is always a choice. The Game always gives a Player a choice. Dan may not be aware he is making the choice, but a choice is made nonetheless.</p>
