TITLE:
Haskell

BODY:
Still don't fully understand the IO Monad. How come `somename <- getLine` has to be extracted specially with `<-`? How come there can't be some op with type `IO String -> String`?

On the other hand, really liking the strict typing, although it takes a while to get stuff right.

Apparent inconsistency: How come if a key in a map is (Int, Int) the type of the map is `Map (Int, Int) Int` without a comma after the `)`?

C'est ne pas une footer.
