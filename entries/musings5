TITLE:
Don't Make me Remember

One of my biggest guiding principles while coding is this:

I hate remembering things.

What that means is that I try to design programs such that I have to remember as little as possible.

Example: Say that you have doSomethingFunction(). You write it, but then you put in the comments: "Don't forget to call cleanupSomethingFunction() when you're done." That seems like enough, right? I mean, you commented it. What more could I want?

No, no, no. This is really bad. See, it's okay right now, and I might even remember it the first and second times that I use doSomethingFunction(), but what if somewhere else I'm editing the code and accidentally remove the cleanup() call, or I use that code as reference to implement some more code and forget the cleanup(), or...

The point is that every line that I write that I will need to remember something about later increases the chance of disaster.

(The right way to solve this problem, by the way, is to pass a function into doSomethingFunction() that does everything that happens in the intermediary before you call cleanupFunction.)
