				Don't Make me Remember

</p> <p>One of my biggest guiding principles while coding is this:

</p> <p>I hate remembering things.

</p> <p>What that means is that I try to design programs such that I have to remember as little as possible.

</p> <p>Example: Say that you have doSomethingFunction(). You write it, but then you put in the comments: "Don't forget to call cleanupSomethingFunction() when you're done." That seems like enough, right? I mean, you commented it. What more could I want?

</p> <p>No, no, no. This is really bad. See, it's okay right now, and I might even remember it the first and second times that I use doSomethingFunction(), but what if somewhere else I'm editing the code and accidentally remove the cleanup() call, or I use that code as reference to implement some more code and forget the cleanup(), or...

</p> <p>The point is that every line that I write that I will need to remember something about later increases the chance of disaster.

</p> <p>(The right way to solve this problem, by the way, is to pass a function into doSomethingFunction() that does everything that happens in the intermediary before you call cleanupFunction.)
