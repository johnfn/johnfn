				<p>So, we're going to start off with the Fibonacci sequence...

</p> <p>Nah, I'm just messing with you. Let's start off with a really simple program that plays the guessing game. You'll think of a number from 1-100, and the computer will try to guess it. I'll show you how I'd build this program up from scratch.

</p> <p><b> Step 1: Hello, world! </b>

</p> <p>Let's start out with a simple greeting. It's always nice to be greeted by your computer, right?

</p> <p><pre>
main = do
  putStrLn "Sup?"
</pre>

</p> <p>Run it! If nothing bad happened, you'll get this:

</p> <p><pre>
Sup?
</pre>

</p> <p>That was easy. Quick overview of what just happened: 

</p> <p><b> Main </b>

</p> <p>`main` is the function where Haskell programs start.

</p> <p><b> do </b>

</p> <p>`do` is special notation that I'll get into in another chapter or two, once we have a more solid understanding of Haskell. Right now, you should know two things about do:

</p> <p>* Only use `do` in functions that do something with IO. (This is a half truth, as you can use `do` in other places too - but you wont do that for a while.)
* `do` makes your code seem imperative - that is, in big do expressions your function structure looks similar to Java or C++. How is this possible in a functional language, you wonder? Think about how that could be. I'll explain in a bit.

</p> <p><b> putStrLn </b>

</p> <p>Simple! Show some words on the screen.

</p> <p>Or is it not so simple? putStrLn is the first time we've <i>called a function</i>. Since we're using a <i>functional</i> language, just filled with functions, the Haskell guys decided it better be as easy as possible. And it is! No parenthesis, no commas. Just `someFunction 1 2 3 4`. Ah, beauty!

</p> <p><b> Step 1.5: Take a bad guess at the user's name. </b>

</p> <p><pre>
main = do
  let yourName = "George"
  putStrLn("Hi, " ++ yourName)
</pre>

</p> <p>Wouldn't it be great if your name was George? I bet I just freaked out all the Georges reading this book. Sorry, George. I didn't mean to surprise you.

</p> <p>What new syntax do we have?

</p> <p><b> let yourName = "George" </b>

</p> <p>That's a function definition!

</p> <p>"That's a function definition?" you ask quizzically. "Why does it start with `let`? The only function I ever defined was `main`, and I never said `let main = blabla`. It looks a lot more like a constant."

</p> <p>That's true. To Haskell, constants and functions are actually one and the same. Haskell is smart enough to know that if a function only returns one value, then it should be treated like a constant. 

</p> <p>As for the `let`, for now we'll say that that's how you define functions inside of `do` blocks. In a bit, you'll see that there is a tiny difference between `do` code and non-`do` code. TODO: Is it really?

</p> <p><b> ++ </b>

</p> <p>This joins two lists together. Into one MEGA LIST.

</p> <p>But wait, you cry! How does it work on Strings? In Haskell, Strings - like `"WAZZUP"` - are just lists of characters.

</p> <p>
</p> <p><b> Step 1.5: A brief interlude about types. </b>

</p> <p>I've skirted around this issue enough!

</p> <p>&lt;Insert comic of guy hiding the IO monad from his gf. It'll be hilarious, I promise.&gt;

</p> <p>One of the big deals about Haskell is its super powerful type system. You've probably heard that before, but don't know what it means. Well, let's find out! Boot up ghci and type this in.

</p> <p><pre>
Prelude> let x = 5
</pre>
