</p> <p>tl;dr: This aims to be a <i>practical</i> guide to Haskell. Above all, I want you to come away from this knowing how to make super cool stuff.

</p> <p>The problem with Haskell tutorials these days is that most of them will go over abstract code sample after abstract code sample. They'll say something like, look! 

</p> <p><pre>
fold (+) (map (\x -> x + 1) [1, 2, 3]) 0
>> 9
</pre>

</p> <p>Isn't that amazing! Didn't you always want to add 1 to each element of an array, and then sum it?!

</p> <p>If you're anything like me, the answer is <i>no</i>. No, I really wasn't in the mood for adding 1 to each element of an array, let alone summing it afterwards. I can't think of why I'd want to do that in the first place.

</p> <p>I learn by doing. I've learned the most about a language when I just sit down and make something awesome with it.

</p> <p>And for me, Haskell (and FP) tutorials are just too abstract.

</p> <p>It's not their fault, though. Let's see what the reason is.

</p> <p><b> Why are non-FP tutorials better? </b>

</p> <p>The great thing about OOP is that it namespaces functions really well. So, if you ever want to find some string-related method, just look at the String object, and boom! There they are. Arrays? Yep, Array class. This is awesome for learning the language, because you have a place to start.

</p> <p><b> And what's wrong with FP tutorials? </b>

</p> <p>Functional programming languages can feel like they're filled with tons of random functions. It can even feel like that's the <i>point!</i> I mean, it's in the name! FUNCTIONAL languages! What do you expect? Not-functions? That'd be some other paradigm.

</p> <p>And so when you try to learn a functional language, people will throw this massive amount of functions at you, because that's clearly the point! Right? 

</p> <p>And since they're so decontextualized, we may as well present them in their purest, most abstract state. 

</p> <p>And now we're writing examples like the first code sample that don't help people like me learn.

</p> <p>Even worse, this gives functional programming a bad rap. Because people only see examples in super abstract mathematical functions, they tend to think of those languages in those terms: obscure, mathematical, abstract. Even scary.

</p> <p>But none of this has to be true. Haskell isn't actually scary, obscure, or abstract[1]. It's a very neat language, for practical applications as well as mathematical ones.

</p> <p>Now let's go make something cool with Haskell!

</p> <p>[1]: I can't deny that it's mathematical, but you don't have to worry about that.
